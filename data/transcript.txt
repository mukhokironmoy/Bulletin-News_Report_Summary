ceasefire in place but the attacks are
still on so is this deal just on paper

infrastructure in both countries is in
focus first as key targets in the war
and now possibly the key to peace so

ukraine's power facilities we'll explain

over the war is back complete with an

a ceasefire amid drone strikes welcome
to peace talks in the 21st century as
strange as it sounds this is the reality
in ukraine there is a ceasefire in place
but it's not clear what it covers
ukraine and the united states say it
covers energy and civilian sides but
russia says only the energy sector the
rest is fair
game and both sides are making good use
of this confusion russia fired 171
drones at ukraine today dozens of them
were shot down but the rest hit targets
across the country video shows smoke and
fire over ukrainian cities similar
strikes were reported yesterday too take
a look at this
[Music]
ukraine also launched attacks today they
fired around 130 drones at russia one of
the targets was the engles air base now
this is not located near the front line
it is more than 700 kilometers away from
ukraine's border 700 km it's also a very
important air base angles hosts russia's
nuclear bomber planes unofficially these
are called white
swans it's not clear if those planes
were damaged but footage showed a
massive fire and damage to a nearby
hospital
[Applause]
like i said it's a strain ceasefire but
the hope is to build on this partial
agreement to ultimately sign a full
ceasefire ukraine is certainly keen on
that yesterday their president wimir
zilinski spoke to donald trump you may
remember how their last conversation
went it ended with zilinski being kicked
out of the white house this time things
went better trump and zalinski spoke for
close to 1 hour the us president called
it a very good phone call he said it
centered around the conversation that he
had with president
putin so basically it was a debrief of
sorts zalinski called the conversation
positive and
frank he also called for a full
truth of course that means making
concessions to
russia but is zilinski willing to make
those concessions
he says there is no pressure from donald
trump to do so
today i have not felt any pressure from
president
trump there wasn't any pressure that's a
fact i am a sincere person if that were
the case i would
say so what are the next steps how do we
turn this partial truce into a full
truce well that requires mainly two
things one is building trust and the
second is more talks and diplomacy
that's what you need trust building will
not be easy not after 3 years of intense
fighting but yesterday we saw a ray of
hope russia and ukraine released 350
prisoners of war that's 175 prisoners
from each side they were released they
were welcomed with celebrations and
relief take a
look
[Applause]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
follow this
this was one of the largest prisoner
swaps since the invasion it's a good
move but it's not going to be enough as
evident from today's drone
exchanges which brings us to the second
step talks and diplomacy engagements are
happening all over europe in brussels
european union leaders huddled for a
summit it was their second meeting this
month all countries except hungary are
expected to back ukraine sovereignity
zilinski spoke to the leaders via video
link again it was sort of a debrief he
told eu leaders about his conversation
with donald trump he also urged putin to
drop so-called unnecessary
demands the second key meeting is
happening in britain british prime
minister kia tama is hosting eu defense
ministers and this meeting is focused on
maintaining the peace like which
countries will deploy peacekeepers what
sort of weapons will ukraine get and how
can russia be deterred that's what
they'll all discuss london says around
30 countries have agreed to
contribute if not with soldiers then in
some other way they'll all pitch in and
prime minister stalmer means business
because ahead of this meeting he made a
big visit starmer traveled to northern
ireland to where the uk's nuclear
weapons are stored and he made it a
point to flaunt them we've just come off
the vanguard class submarine uh to see
the team and they've just been on a tour
constantly at sea part of our nuclear
deterrence and it was the opportunity to
say to them at the end of a long patrol
uh welcome home and thank you uh for the
incredible work that they've put in
keeping our country uh safe um and uh
working with nato allies on an essential
part of our defense capabilities
so europe and the uk are coordinating
and their approach will be very
significant because zilinski knows that
europe is more reliable than donald
trump so he will depend on advice and
input from europe apparently president
macron of france is taking the lead here
zilinski says he speaks to macron almost
every day in fact yesterday macron
called zilinski during zilinski's press
conference this is how it played out
okay man man sorry manuel i i have just
conversation with the journalist can i
can i be back in some minutes in 15 20
minutes
yeah please thank you thank you man okay
great great byebye
yes i have just spoken to president mron
to emanuel we often talk a lot once a
day on average
clearly keen to get on the phone but
i'll tell you who isn't president
vladimir putin of russia trump and putin
were scheduled to speak on tuesday and
this call was slated for 400 p.m moscow
time before that putin was attending a
business summit even as 400 p.m neared
the russian president showed no
intention of
leaving when reminded putin shrugged it
off
[Laughter]
[Applause]
[Music]
reports say putin kept trump waiting for
1
hour it's an old russian strategy
leaders before putin have also used it
in late 1949 china's president maong
visited moscow and joseph stalin made
him wait for five weeks five weeks for
one
meeting putin was certainly quicker than
that he made trump wait for an hour but
it's not clear what his strategy
is next week could offer some clues
russia and the us russian and us
officials will be meeting in saudi
arabia on monday ukrainian officials
will also be in the kingdom on the same
day so let's see if something comes out
of it the russian side is clearly keen
to continue the fighting especially
because of the situation in kursk this
is russian territory kursk almost 90% of
this territory has been liberated from
ukraine so why would putin pause now as
for ukraine it's all about the consensus
in europe zilinski is leaning on them
for support and advice let's hope the
europeans advise peace and
pragmatism so after two phone calls and
hours of negotiation ukraine's future
hinges on power i'm talking about their
energy infrastructure vladimir putin has
agreed to stop attacking it and this is
part of the limited ceasefire deal that
he has accepted a deal that he
negotiated with donald
trump and trump himself now wants a
share he wants to run ukraine's power
plants so this is the new bargaining
chip ukraine's energy infrastructure it
is getting a lot of attention now in
fact throughout this war it has been a
target according to reports ukraine has
suffered 1,000 attacks in 3 years and
2/3 of its power grid has been wiped out
some 8 million households have been
plunged into darkness this has happened
through various stages of the conflict
long story short russia has relentlessly
targeted ukraine's energy supplies and
it has proved to be an effective war
strategy you see in any war power
stations are vulnerable by striking them
russia wanted to weaken ukraine and dent
the morale of its people without power
they were forced to suffer harsh
conditions especially during the winter
months when temperatures plunge below
zero without electricity or gas
ukrainians have struggled to survive in
the cold and russia has been ruthless on
this front it has launched mass attacks
on power facilities using drones and
powerful missiles and to a large extent
russia has been successful but
thankfully for ukraine there was never a
total
blackout so this limited ceasefire is a
welcome breakthrough for kiev it secures
their power facilities the ukrainian
president says he wants a watertight
agreement with the russians
we were talking about energy security
energy networks and other civilian
infrastructure that is why i have told
president trump that i think it is
important that we prepare the list of
objects formats that russian long range
missile could not hit because we're
thinking that those objects fit the list
of energy and civilian infrastructure
it is a limited ceasefire but both
ukraine and russia will welcome it
because ukraine too has targeted russian
energy infrastructure repeatedly kiev
has been launching attacks on russian
oil supplies it has hit oil refineries
depots storage units pipelines and
pumping stations the goal was to hurt
russian oil supplies in some cases kia
was successful it disrupted the flow of
oil specifically from russian seapport
terminals and also the drewba
pipeline this pipeline is an economic
lifeline for russia it supplies crude to
some european nations reports say
ukraine cut russia's oil refining
capacity by as much as
10% moscow though dismisses this claim
essentially they're both playing the
same
game russia targeted ukraine's power
supply ukraine targeted russia's economy
to dent revenues from oil
exports and this is still happening
yesterday there were fresh strikes in
russia ukraine attacked the city of
crash nodar
this is a shipment and storage facility
or the city has a shipment and storage
facility it processes more than 28,000
barrels of oil per
day this oil is meant for export kiev
attacked it using suicide drones it led
to a massive fire reports say one oil
reservoir was burnt
unfortunately we see that for now there
is no reciprocity on the part of the kv
regime there have been attempts to
strike our energy infrastructure
facilities you know about that
information on this is also available so
we are closely watching whether the k of
regime will listen to the firm intention
of the presidents of russia and the
united states to do everything possible
step by step to get on the track of a
peaceful settlement so they're
exchanging fire and
accusations russia says ukraine is
attacking its energy facilities and
ukraine says russia is attacking its
power infrastructure this sounds like a
ceasefire only on paper it is yet to
take effect the terms are yet to be
worked out both sides could use this
reprieve
though the ceasefire won't end the war
it will just be a temporary pause but a
crucial one if it holds this 30-day
period could be the beginning of the end
of the war
a lot of people dying and there are
hostages in gaza they're still waiting
to release
israel is striking gaza again the first
blow landed on tuesday the fragile
ceasefire was in danger and today there
was a second round of air strikes so
it's no longer a violation it's the end
of the ceasefire war has resumed in the
gaza strip and that is the new reality
let's bring you the latest updates
overnight israel conducted multiple
strikes more than 90 people were killed
most of them were sleeping in their
homes at dawn israel resumed its ground
operation it has taken control of the
ned zarim
corridor if you look at the
map this corridor is right in the middle
of gaza it connects the north to the
south in the month of january israel had
withdrawn from this corridor after the
ceasefire came into effect a private
security agency was stationed there
however on wednesday israel moved back
into the area it took control of the
checkpoints and closed off all access
[Music]
so israel has basically created a buffer
zone gazins can no longer travel from
north to south or vice versa
plus 150,000 people have been asked to
evacuate and they don't know where to go
this is not a life we urge the mediators
we are the ones paying the price with
our children and women what is this we
can't find the time to get displaced we
get displaced every
day so why is israel back in the strip
we told you about this yesterday israel
says these new strikes are to build
pressure on hamas to ensure the
immediate release of hostages the
israeli defense minister has a message
for gazins return the hostages and expel
hamas or face israel's wroth
the evacuation of civilians from combat
zones will start soon if all israeli
hostages are not released and hamas is
not removed from gaza israel will act
with forces you have never known before
so israel says this escalation is to get
the hostages back but their families are
not convinced in fact they're furious
with the government 59 israeli hostages
are still in gaza 24 of them are
believed to be alive a cabinet meeting
was scheduled for today a meeting
between the government and the families
of these hostages but this meeting was
postponed the israeli prime minister has
not given a reason why and this has left
the families in a limbo they say the
government has abandoned the hostages
they want an immediate end to the war
when idf start the war
again as if if we say something it's
against them it's against the soldiers
but it's not against the soldiers it's
against our government that that
betrayed our people and our the
civilians of israel and the and and the
soldiers
which brings us to hamas today its armed
wing fired a salvo of rockets towards
tel aviv this was in response to the
recent escalation some of the rockets
were intercepted others fell in an open
area hamas is also talking to key
mediators like qatar and egypt these are
the countries that helped seal the first
ceasefire so hamas wants their help to
return to the table to begin talks for
the second phase but it's not going to
be easy when the ceasefire deal was
agreed upon netanyahu's government
became vulnerable his coalition has some
far-right members they left the
government the likes of itamar bengavir
they were against the ceasefire so they
pulled out of the government after
tuesday's attack they're back and this
is very crucial
politically their exit left the prime
minister with a very slim majority and
their return has restored stability in
the government it has allowed them to
pass a key budget today a wartime budget
and this budget is critical had they not
passed it israel would have faced snap
elections netanyahu would most probably
have left lost office so resuming this
war in gaza is not just a military
pressure tactic it is very much a
political move and israelis seem to see
through it there were protests in
several parts of the country asking for
prime minister netanyahu's resignation
on wednesday night thousands marched to
jerusalem they were stopped by water
cannons and police force
[Applause]
[Applause]
meanwhile netanyahu has blamed the deep
state he's accused them of weaponizing
israel's justice system he first posted
this from his official account on x he
later deleted the post and he reposted
it from his personal account so this is
how things stand in israel elsewhere in
the region there's more turbulence the
houthis are back again they have
attacked four us warships in the last 72
hours and their new target seems to be
tel aviv on tuesday they fired a
ballistic missile towards israel it was
intercepted yesterday they struck again
the houthis fired a missile targeting
the benguran airport in israel this one
too was intercepted but it triggered
sirens in tel aviv and jerusalem
the missile force of the yemen armed
forces carried out a qualitative
military operation targeting bengurian
airport and the occupied jaffa region
with a palestine 2 hypersonic ballistic
missile this operation successfully
achieved its objective thanks be to
allah so gaza is burning again with
bombs falling as if they never stopped
the hostages are still missing west asia
is on the edge again it's like the
ceasefire never happened
the question is what comes
next well another ceasefire may come but
it may also
crumble this looks like a war with no
exit
[Music]
we have asked a lot of questions about
ai like will it take over jobs will it
impact national security and will it
replace search engines but here's a
strange one how do you discipline a
rogue ai
model i'm talking about grock the ai bot
created by elon musk it's on the
government's radar here in india why
because of abuses and problematic
takes who knew a teenager and grock
would be the same but a rebellious teen
is not a national issue grock could be
first let me tell you what the problem
is elon musk launched the latest version
of grock last month you can use it on x
formerly known as twitter mention your
grock's id in mention grock's id in your
post and grock will reply just one
problem though this ai bot has turned
abusive it has started responding with
hindi cuss words of course we can't show
that here but i'm sure you've seen what
i'm talking about and that is only the
first problem the second problem is this
grock is wading into indian politics it
is branding certain leaders as corrupt
and undemocratic and that too without
proof this is new territory for ai bots
yes they've been accused of
misinformation but grock is also being
accused of having an attitude problem
why is that the answer is programming
grock is not going rogue it was designed
to be rogue in fact let me quote the
company's philosophy grock on x an ai
assistant with a twist of humor and a
dash of
rebellion i guess abuses now count as
humor either way that tells you why
grock is acting out as for the response
the government is on it reports say new
delhi has react has in fact reached out
to officials at x the it ministry is
looking into it into whether grock has
violated indian rules they're
investigating specifically india's it
rules i'm sure the law will take its
course but tonight we also want to focus
on the human response on how we should
deal with ai
bots it's tempting to see these models
as a perfect source of
knowledge but they're not they are messy
cauldrons of data all ai models are made
using bits of data and that may include
propaganda that may include fake news
and yes sometimes also abusive language
unlike humans ai does not know what is
right or wrong it simply absorbs
everything it
gets of course the makers can try try to
install certain filters for example chat
gpt often refuses to answer political
questions and that's an inbuilt filter
on the bot but grock has no such
filters so then what do we do the users
we say start using your own
processor i'm talking about our
brain human
intelligence when ai bots tell you
something don't believe it hook line and
sinker do your own research maybe read a
book and then come to a conclusion
because ai models do get a lot of things
wrong look at this study from 2024 it
says ai bots agreed with false
statements 26% of the time
here's another study it found that ai
search engines showed wrong sources 60%
of the time so your first
job is to accept this truth that ai bots
are not perfect if you still insist on
believing them i have an experiment for
you we asked grock a simple question are
you always right that's what we asked
and look at the answer no i'm not always
right i'm not infallible
even grock admits that it can be wrong
so humans should accept it
too as for this controversy expect it to
blow up because it's not just about
grock x and india are facing off over
another issue as well and that is
censorship elon musk's company has filed
a case against the government of india
it is accusing new delhi of excess
censorship the same thing happened in
2022 as well x refused to comply with
india's censorship rules we thought that
saga was behind us but clearly it's not
india's it rules allow appropriate
government bodies to censor content they
can ask x to take down inflammatory
things like hate speech or fake news x
says this power has been granted to way
too many people all center central
ministries state governments and tens of
thousands of police officers
now we haven't heard the government's
response yet but this has all the
makings of a new flash
point now let's talk about elon musk's
tesla the electric car company over the
past few weeks it has fallen victim to a
range of attacks with molotov cocktails
aimed at tesla showrooms and cyber
trucks being set ablaze these attacks
are happening across the us canada and
europe
they're part of the tesla takedown
protests now full points for
alliteration but donald trump is not so
happy with the way things are playing
out he is taking tesla attacks in the us
very seriously and his administration is
calling them acts of domestic
terrorism so what's behind this anger
against tesla here's a report
in colorado molotov cocktails thrown at
tesla cars and the word nazi spray
painted on tesla dealership
buildings in south carolina fire set to
tesla charging
stations in oregon molotov cocktails
thrown at a tesla store and more than a
dozen bullets fired at another
showroom in seattle cyber trucks set on
fire and now in las vegas several tesla
vehicles shot at and set ablaze the word
resist was painted in red on the store's
doors different places different kinds
of attacks but one common link attacks
on property carrying the logo of tesla
are cropping up across the united states
be it on showrooms vehicle lots or
charging
stations so far no injuries have been
reported and in some cases like colorado
and south carolina people have been
charged but let's state the obvious
these attacks are not about tesla
vehicles no matter how oddly shaped they
come these attacks aren't about the
electric car company either it's about
the person who owns the said company
elon musk the close adviser of us
president donald trump and the leader of
doge the department of government
efficiency
in recent weeks there have been
dogeriven cuts to the federal workforce
and agencies public anger is bubbling
and now there are #tesla takedown
protests
those who aren't lighting teslas on fire
are putting up cheeky stickers on their
own teslas saying "i bought this before
we knew elon was
crazy those who can't afford a tesla are
posting on social media or taking to the
streets."
i decided that i wanted to join the
protest
here and um send a message to elon musk
in a way that i think is very um direct
um we could adversely impact sales and
inflict financial pain on him similar to
the financial pain that he's inflicting
on our veterans our seniors and a lot of
less fortunate people in the us along
with our federal workers
so now the us government is cracking the
whip the fbi is investigating attacks
targeting tesla vehicles not as acts of
vandalism no they are investigating
tesla desecration as a potential act of
terrorism attorney general pam bondi has
released a statement she calls these
attacks nothing short of domestic
terrorism you heard that right the trump
administration is expanding the
definition of domestic terrorism for the
great genius elon musk
now it will include spray paint on
electric vehicles which is kind of
ironic considering that president trump
issued mass pardons for more than a
thousand january 6th riers who stormed
the capital
building but moving past that in a
recent interview trump has said that the
attackers are paid by people who are
very highly political on the left
meanwhile bondi has promised to impose
severe consequences on those involved in
these attacks including those operating
behind the scenes to coordinate and fund
these
crimes speaking of funding these
protests are mostly against musk's
powerful but dubious role in cutting the
size of the us government so that the
trump administration can call vandalism
terrorism but by the looks of it the
anger is here to stay and not just in
the united states there have been
peaceful protests outside tesla
dealerships in europe as well the uk
germany and portugal also in canada
there have been some not so peaceful
attacks as well earlier this month a
dozen teslas were torched in
france this week four teslas were burnt
to a crisp in germany and the damage
isn't just physical tesla is bleeding
cash the company's stock doubled in
value soon after trump's election but
since then it has shed all those gains
the stock is down more than 30% in
europe sales are down
45% it seems that during trump's first
term his properties in new york and
washington were the obvious places for
protest but in his second term tesla is
filling that gap
now let's turn our attention to turkey
for 22 years the country has been ruled
by one man reep erdogan despite poor
governance despite sky-high inflation
despite crashing turkeykey's currency
the lra erdogan has clung onto
power so what's the secret of his
longlasting
reign these headlines should give you a
hint yes erdogan's top rival has been
locked up his name is ekim imamolu he is
the mayor of istanbul turkeykey's
economic capital he has been mayor of
istanbul since 2019 that's when he
defeated erdogan's party in 2019 before
this they were in power for 15 years
istanbul was erdogan's turf imam molu
took it six years back and since then
erdogan has tried to oust him multiple
times but the istanbul mayor has held on
and he was expected to take the fight to
erdogan himself in the next turkish
election imam molu was supposed to
become his party's presidential
candidate
and this was scheduled for sunday but
before that could happen he was arrested
apparently on corruption and terrorism
charges immolu is accused of committing
fraud during his time as mayor he's also
accused of helping a group linked to the
pkk the kurdish party which turkey
accuses or considers a terrorist
outfit so those are the charges against
imamolu graft and helping
terrorists it's so fortunate for erdogan
that these things just came to light
days before imamolu could officially
become his presidential rival
can you believe the coincidence
immolu of course was not surprised he
saw the police lining up outside his
house yesterday so he put out this video
while getting ready for his arrest
[Music]
for he remained calm as you can see
straightened his tie and surrendered to
the police you know who wasn't calm the
erdogan regime they deployed police
everywhere they barricaded the streets
shut down some metro stations and put a
4-day ban on public gatherings obviously
that did not work
[Applause]
there was a massive rally in istanbul
last night thousands took to the streets
they were waving turkish flags and
making their voices heard imamu's wife
was also there she addressed his
supporters
[Music]
[Music]
and it wasn't just istanbul protest
broke out in the capital ankara as well
people even clashed with riot police
take a look
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
the protest continued today despite an
escalating crackdown social media sites
are down the internet has been slowed
people have been arrested for their
posts online
it's a full-fledged crackdown on
disscent and opposition one protester
put it quite well
today a coup was made against turkish
democracy a civilian coup
[Music]
we'll be tracking the story as it
develops now let's turn to canada its
diplomats cannot catch a break canada
could be headed for a snap election the
new prime minister mark carney could
call for it in april now with this
election looming canada's foreign
ministry is jumping from one crisis to
another their ties with india already
strained thanks to their former prime
minister and now their relationship with
china has taken another hit earlier this
year canada or china rather executed
four canadian nationals china executed
four canadian nationals they were
convicted of drugrelated crimes all of
them held dual citizenship they were
both canadian and chinese but china does
not recognize dual nationality so it
insists that these executions are an
internal matter what's worse the
executions happened months ago but
ottawa just found out about them here's
a report
canada's relations with china have hit a
new low earlier this year china executed
four canadians they were convicted on
drug crimes and ottawa just found out
about this but that's not the most
shocking detail china claims that they
were never canadian to begin
with combating drugrelated crimes is a
shared responsibility of all countries
china is a country governed by the rule
of law and treats defendants of all
nationalities equally the canadian side
should respect the spirit of the rule of
law and stop interfering in china's
judicial sovereignty
they were dual nationals citizens of
both china and canada canada's foreign
minister melanie jolly has spoken she
has been tracking the cases for months
she had tried to intervene alongside
other officials even former prime
minister justin trudeau made an attempt
but they couldn't stop the executions
because beijing doesn't recognize dual
nationality canada has condemned the
deaths but it's falling on deaf ears the
identities of these four individuals
have been withheld there's one more
canadian on death row in china his name
is robert shelonburg again he's a
canadian sentenced for drug smuggling
ottawa has appealed to beijing for
clemency just like it did in the
previous cases but canada has failed to
move the needle with china the impass
sums up the state of canada china ties
the relationship has been tense for
years now it hit a low point in 2018
when ottawa arrested a former huawei
executive her name is mang wanhao she's
the daughter of the founder of huawei
ren jhenf mang was charged with fraud by
the us back then beijing had retaliated
by jailing two canadians in 2021 there
was a breakthrough when mang was
released after a deal with us
authorities but ties haven't improved
since then canada and china are locked
in a trade war now ottawa has raised
duties on a range of chinese goods from
food and farm produce to chinese steel
and aluminium and even electric vehicles
china has hit back with equal force
these executions could be a message from
beijing and a strong one that china has
no intention of mending its ties with
canada
there's a battle for india's waistline
and america's ellie liilly just took the
lead the us farmer giant has officially
launched monaro it's a popular weight
loss drug primarily used for type 2
diabetes and now it's here in india so
how does it work what does it cost and
why is it in india first things first
monjaro is a diabetes drug like i said
it is an injectable medicine developed
by ellie liilly in 2022 it was approved
in the united states and this approval
was for type 2 diabetes but it's also
used for weight loss and here's how it
works munjaro mimics two key gut
hormones gip and glp1 these are hormones
this injection acts like them it
increases insulin production it slows
down digestion it suppresses appetite
and it makes you feel fuller so you eat
less and you shed kilos or you shed them
faster that's how it helps in weight
loss now let's look at the cost the
injection is available in several
dosages from 2 mg to 15 mg and you need
to administer it once a week in india a
single dose of 2.5 mg will cost around
3,500 rupees 5 mg will be for 4,300
rupees so the total cost per month could
be anywhere between 14,000 to 17,000
indian rupees which is high for most
people but much lower than other such
injections and this brings us to the
question why did they launch in india
the simple answer is the sheer size the
size of the indian market 80 million
people are obese in this country 8080
million and other 225 million people are
overweight india is third in global
obesity rankings right behind the us and
china by 2034 11% of our population will
be
obese this makes india a major market
for weight loss drugs and the demand is
rising in 2022 india's weight loss
market was worth $180 million in the
next three years it could be worth
$336 million that is the projection so
monjaru's entry is just the start others
will follow both homegrown options and
foreign ones despite this reshaping
india's weight loss market will take
more there are some key points to
consider the first is greater
accessibility you see drugs like omic
are expensive not everyone can afford
them indian pharma giants are working on
some alternatives some generic versions
which should be cheaper there's also
another silver lining drugs like ompic
contain an active ingredient called
semaglutide it's the semaglutide that
causes the weight loss danish company
novo nordisk has the patent for
semaglutide no one else can make a
similar drug not legally but that patent
expires in india in 2026 so next year
indian drug makers can make generic
versions of this and they should be
cheaper the second point to note is the
shift in treatment norms india has long
relied on diet and lifestyle
modifications but these drugs provide an
alternative they also come with risks
once a person starts taking such a drug
there's a question of long-term
dependency how does this change our
relationship with food and exercise all
of this will have to be discussed and
navigated the third point is regulatory
challenges using monjaro will need a
doctor's approval so you will need a
prescription but how do you control
unauthorized sales how do you prevent
counterfeits india will have to look
into that and then there's also the
social impact the rise of weight loss
drugs could change beauty
standards could people feel pressure to
take these drugs even if they don't need
them could it redefine success in
fitness from hard work to just an
injection
these are all questions that india must
look at
addressing and then comes the biggest
one of all what if demand outstrips
supply who gets priority in such a
situation is it those who need it
medically the diabetic patients or those
who want it for cosmetic weight
loss so as india opens its doors to this
new generation of weight loss drugs it
must also open its eyes to the
challenges that come with it
because the battle for india's waistline
is not just about losing weight it's
about who controls the future of weight
loss
itself our next story is from africa
from somalia in the east somalia has
been fighting a terrorist insurgency for
years against a group called al-shabaab
these terrorists control vast swades of
somalia and they carry out regular
attacks on tuesday al-shabaab went for
the big prize they targeted somalia's
president hassan shik
mahmud the president was on his way to
the airport and a roadside bomb exploded
as his convoy was passing by the
president escaped unharmed but the blast
killed at least four people here's our
report
this is the aftermath of a bomb blast in
somalia in the capital
mogadishu a building was reduced to
rubble smoke and dust filled the air and
people were seen searching through the
debris the blast left at least four
people dead but the count could be
higher
a big explosion rocked mugadishu's hama
jajab district especially the host
neighborhood the abdi khan building has
collapsed entirely people whom we know
and others we don't know were killed in
the bomb attack it is a deplorable
incident and we don't want it to happen
again i have heard between seven to
eight people were killed in the attack
the terrorist group al-shabaab has taken
responsibility for the attack their
target this time was the president of
somalia himself hassan shik muhammad
al-shabaab tried to get him with a
roadside bomb as his convoy was leaving
the presidential palace and heading
towards the airport muhammad was
scheduled to board a flight to somalia's
middle shabel region to the front lines
in the fight against
al-shabaab so it seems the terror group
tried to get him first the bomb managed
to hit muhammad's convoy but the somali
president was unharmed he made it to the
airport local media later shared
pictures of him in fatigues purportedly
from the front lines so the attack
doesn't seem to have changed his
plans meanwhile al-shabaab continued
their attacks targeting the airport in
mogadishu and a nearby area which houses
foreign embassies
this follows a deadly attack last week
where al-shabaab stormed a hotel killing
at least 10 people
somalia has been fighting against
al-shabaab's insurgency for years since
2009 that's when the group took control
of central and southern somalia and in
2012 al-shabaab declared their
allegiance to al-qaeda
the united states and other western
nations have joined somalia in the fight
against
al-shabaab the african union has taken
on a leading role supplying troops as
part of the
aussom the african union support and
stabilization mission in somalia but
despite everyone coming together they
still haven't been able to oust
al-shabaab and every year the group ends
up killing hundreds of people
the attack on president hassan shik
muhammad may have failed but this is a
grim reminder of how dangerous the
al-shabaab can
be for our last story tonight let's go
back to 1938 that's when researchers at
harvard asked an important question what
makes a person thrive what makes for a
good life a happy life
so they carried out a
study they recruited 724 participants a
combination of harvard students and
low-income youngsters from
boston researchers tracked their lives
from childhood troubles to their
weddings to final days they gathered
health records they asked detailed
questions they took dna samples
performed brain scrans they tracked the
children of the original subjects and
then tracked their children and this
went on for 85
years this study became the longest ever
on human happiness an 85 year long study
and finally one very clear finding
emerged now when asked what makes for a
happy life scientists confidently say
strong relationships that is the key
strong relationships sure a lot of other
factors also matter a lot of things make
you happy like for donald trump maybe it
is a fantasy of a greenland invasion or
for kim kim jong-un another luxury
mayback but more than money iq or social
class it is our bonds with people that
make us happier they determine our level
of
fulfillment and why are we telling you
this because today is the international
day of happiness the unsaid official day
to talk joy to celebrate all kinds of
good things and to obsess over the world
happiness report now this is like a
subjective index of happiness it is seen
as a global barometer of joy and it
releases every year this year it gives
us something
predictable finland is once again the
world's happiest country apparently for
the eighth year in a row but the report
also told us something
surprising almost 1/if of youngsters are
unhappy the world over 1/5if of them and
this is a 39% increase compared to two
decades ago today 19% young adults have
no social support they believe they have
no one to count on they have most of
their meals alone they don't go out as
much it is a sad state of affairs quite
literally
but youngsters are not isolated in their
isolation the world over onethird of
adults are lonely and
unsurprisingly unhappiness has hit a
record
high and this comes as good news for
capitalism for the millions of books
podcasts and movies on happiness for the
$1.8 trillion global wellness market for
the plush market even after all in the
last quarter adults and listen to this
in the last quarter adults spent more
than $1.5 billion on toys for
themselves they may sound like the this
may sound like the cost of happiness but
experts say that it rarely
works the problem is not so much about
what people are doing like sharing reels
on their phones or buying a new candle
that makes them happy it's more about
what people are not doing they are not
going to that birthday party they're not
sitting with others during lunch they
are withdrawing from experiences and
this saps
joy and the harvard study is hardly the
only one that says so ample research
shows that people who are more socially
connected are
happier they live longer they have
lesser stress and when we are happy we
are healthier we work better we are
better positioned for success so my
point is quite simple yes the world can
be an unsettling place yes there's a lot
going on and a lot going wrong and when
you're feeling tired or stressed it is
hard to find the motivation to socialize
but scientists say that happiness is not
something that just happens to you
happiness like a muscle needs to be
exercised much of it is linked to social
fitness it can be
improved and it it can set us up on
course for a happier
