you put out one fire another one breaks
out that's the situation in West Asia
things had just started to stabilize in
Gaza and Lebanon but there's a new flash
point in Yemen it's the houthis versus
the United States
on Saturday president Donald Trump
announced a military operation he
accused the houis of piracy and
terrorism the houis as you would know
are an armed group in Yemen they are
funded and backed by Iran they control
Yemen's capital saana and the Northwest
now Trump had a a direct message for
them if your attacks do not stop hell
will rain down upon you that's what he
told the houthis later that day he did
exactly that the US launched air strikes
on houthi targets
they mainly hit the capital saana and
the houti stronghold of Sada the US
military posted videos of the attack
take a look at this
Trump and his officials were monitoring
the strikes the White House later
published some pictures they show Trump
in his typical golfing attire white
T-shirt and a red Maga hat over in Yemen
the toll is massive houti officials say
at least 53 people have been killed
which includes five children they say
the US hit residential areas in Yemen
and the video show the true extent of
the
damage you can see mangled beam blocks
of broken concrete and buildings reduced
to Rubble take a look at this now
many people are still missing search
operations are underway in Sana and Sada
the goal is to rescue people trapped
under the rubble but right now time is
running out for them and the US is not
done yet their military says this
operation will continue the first round
of strikes was on Saturday and the
second was this morning Trump's National
Security adviser claimed multiple houi
leaders had been taken out he says the
attacks are meant to be overwhelming the
difference is uh these were not kind of
pin prick back and forth uh what
ultimately proved to be feckless attacks
uh this was an overwhelming response
that actually targeted multiple houthi
leaders and took them out uh and the
difference here is one going after the
houi leadership and two holding Iran
responsible so the US is not interested
in Restraint they want to drive fear
into the hearts of the houthis which
raises two questions
why now and will it work you see since
2023 the houthis have been attacking
ships in the Red Sea first they targeted
only Israeli ships but eventually other
vessels were also hit their goal was to
put pressure on Israel to make them stop
the war in Gaza when the war ended so
did the houi attacks then earlier this
month something changed Israel cut off
humanitarian Aid to Gaza so the houthis
asked Israel to lift the aid embargo if
not they threatened to resume the
attacks days after that Trump ordered
the strikes which brings us to the
second question is it even
working in public the huthis are defined
they claim to have attacked us warships
in the Red Sea specifically The Truman
aircraft
carrier the htis say they will meet
escalation with
escalation now we will meet escalation
with escalation we will respond to the
American enemy in its raids it attacks
with strikes by targeting its aircraft
carriers its warships its ships it will
be included in the ban and yet we still
have escalatory options if it continues
its aggression we will move to
additional escalatory options God
willing the huis did fire 11 drones at
the Truman but the US claims that all of
them were shot down now if this conflict
continues it would lead to major changes
for starters it will weaken Iran further
their proxies have been crippled in the
last two years first it was Hamas in
Gaza then it was hisbah in Lebanon if
you add Bashar Al Assad's outa in Syria
it's been setback after setback for Iran
the houthis had largely escaped this
Onslaught but Trump has set his sight on
them it's the perfect chance to weaken
another Iranian
proxy and how is Iran responding to this
as always they they've distanced
themselves from the
huis inor
as representatives of the yemenis make
their strategic and operational
decisions on their own the Islamic
Republic of Iran plays no role in
setting the national or operational
policies of any faction of the
resistance front including
Yemen a lot depends on Trump's goals he
says he wants to stop the Red Sea
attacks but no attacks have been
reported since the Gaza ceasefire plus
the US is acting alone here former
President Joe Biden had also launched
strikes on Yemen but those were joint
operations Britain and France joined the
American strikes under Biden but this
time the US has acted alone all of this
makes you wonder what is Trump's end
goal does he want to deter the houthis
or wipe them out the answer could
reshape west Asia's immediate
future now let's talk about the prime
minister of New Zealand his name is
Christopher luxen he is on a 5-day visit
to India and he's the chief guest for
this year's RIS our dialogue in fact
tomorrow morning prime minister luxen
will be right here at the ideas SP
Studio to inaugurate it so make sure you
don't miss our coverage in the meantime
let's tell you more about the visit and
the bilateral ties between India and New
Zealand prime minister luxen arrived in
New Delhi last night and he has come
with a large delegation perhaps the
largest Aki prime minister has ever
traveled
with and in India Prime Minister Modi
rolled out the red carpet for him
[Music]
New Zealand is eager to expand ties with
India prime minister luxen is personally
investing in this relationship and he's
no stranger to India before becoming
prime minister luxon worked in the
private sector he was associated with
Brands like unila and Air New Zealand
as an executive he used to visit India
quite frequently and it was during those
visits that luxen became bullish on the
India story he witnessed the rise of the
Indian middle class he saw how they were
getting wealthy and how the Indian
economy was expanding
rapidly luxen in fact has spoken about
this let me quote from what he said
India's Got A rapidly Rising middle
class which creates huge trade
opportunities those citizens now don't
have worries about where their house is
or what they're going to be eating
tonight they're actually saving for the
retirement they sending their kids
off on education they want to travel
more and that's a huge opportunity for
us that opportunity is why prime
minister luxen is what prime minister
luxen rather is hoping to tap
on he wants a trade deal with India as
of today India's trade with New Zealand
is not very much last year both sides
traded good worth just about $1
billion this is from April 2024 to
January 2025 $1 billion of bilateral
trade prime minister luxon wants a
comprehensive economic partnership with
India in fact this is something that he
that that he campaigned on a promise
that he campaigned on during the
election and today he's got an opening
India and New Zealand will launch
negotiations for a trade deal I'm
pleased to welcome the efforts of
Minister goyel and Minister m Clay on
their agreement announced yesterday
between New Zealand and India that we
will launch immediately uh free
comprehensive Free Trade Agreement uh
negotiations making sure that we work
towards a balanced ambitious and
comprehensive agreement India and New
Zealand will restart free trade talks
these discussions have been frozen for
10 years now and it's not like leaders
before luxen did not try but there's
little to show for it even after 10
years we don't have a deal on the table
the plan is for negotiators to meet next
month and fast trck this effort luxon
wants to double New Zealand's exports in
10 years and he believes that India
could help him get there so that's one
of his key priorities trade the second
one is
security like India New Zealand too has
a China problem earlier this year
Chinese ships provoked the ks the pla
sent three naval vessels they conducted
live fire exercises near New
Zealand it shows you how far China wants
to spread its
turve its Army is building pressure on
countries as far away as New Zealand the
Chinese Army it is also tapping New
Zealand's Neighbors in fact in February
China and Cook Islands signed a pact a
comprehensive strategic partnership now
Cook Islands are a group of 15 small
Islands they are located between New
Zealand and Hawaii this area is
considered as New Zealand's backyard so
the Cook Islands deal with China was a
jolt for The
KES China wants to control the entire
Indo Pacific and this is a matter of
concern because Beijing is creating
security threats for both India and New
Zealand which is why prime minister
luxen wants India's help he wants
greater defense cooperation he wants
more military drills with India and New
Delhi would be Keen to reciprocate but
there is one Hiccup and that is
khalistani
separatism last year there was a
khalistan referendum in ockland New
Zealand allowed this event to go ahead
it was organized by seeks for justice
which is a terrorist organization that
has been banned in India but New Zealand
allowed them to hold a referendum on
breaking up India so you can imagine how
sensitive this is for New Delhi
khalistanis are separatists and groups
like siks for justice have been involved
in Terror
activities they call for breaking up the
Punjab state from India India has taken
a strong stand on this issue and we all
know what happened with Canada so New
Zealand's response to India's concerns
on this matter will be key
so far it has made the right noises in a
statement last year New Zealand said it
respects India's territorial
integrity and now with their prime
minister visiting and talking about
deepening the partnership we hope these
wrinkles will be ired
[Music]
out we want to see if we can bring that
war to an end maybe we can maybe we
can't but I think we have a very good
chance
[Music]
last summer Ukraine was riding high they
had launched strikes inside Russia their
forces were gaining ground in the K
region in Russia and in the US they had
a steadfast Ally in Joe Biden but a year
later the tide has turned Washington
support is wavering Russia is hitting
back hard and K has slipped Beyond
Ukraine's
grasp a phone call tomorrow could seal
its Fate on Tuesday US president Donald
Trump will talk to Russian President
Vladimir Putin and on the agenda is the
ceasefire a lot of work's been done over
the weekend we want to see if we can
bring that war to an end maybe we can
maybe we can't but I think we have a
very good chance well I think we'll you
know be talking about land there's a lot
of land is a lot different than it was
before the wars you know and we'll be
talking about land we'll be talking
about power
plants that's up you know that's a big
question but I think we have a lot of it
uh already discussed very much by both
sides you'll ask him Ukraine and Russia
you'll ask him to we're already talking
about that dividing up certain
assets Trump says there's a lot to talk
about Putin says he wants Ironclad
guarantees in fact the Russians have
spelled it out demand number one Ukraine
will not join NATO two Ukraine will
remain neutral and three only unarmed
postconflict observers will be deployed
to Ukraine in other words no European
soldiers those are Russia's key demands
Washington is yet to comment on them but
Europe has something to say the UK and
France were willing to send a
peacekeeping force to k a forc to
monitor the ceasefire
implementation but Moscow doesn't want
that and now France says it does not
need Russia's
permission president macron of France
was asked about this and he said Ukraine
is a Sovereign Nation so it's not up to
Russia to
decide and what about Ukraine is it
ready to accept Russia's peace terms
well it's not clear at the moment but
frankly they don't have much of a choice
there's a good chance the US will
accommodate some of moscow's concerns
and if that happens if the US leans
towards Moscow K will have to accept the
terms so far they have agreed to one
concession and this is according to a
new report it says Kev is okay with the
West dropping Russian sanctions as long
as it ensures Ukraine security whatever
that means the fact is that KV is in no
position to dictate terms neither at the
talking table nor more on the
battlefield in fact on the ground things
are further unraveling for Ukraine in
2024 Kev controlled nearly 1200 square
kilm of K 1200 square kilm of Russian
territory in K but now they're losing
control of it it began in January when
North Korean troops entered the war they
fought alongside the Russian forces and
their assault was relentless Ukraine's
grip on K began to slip by mid February
Russian forces were on the Move drones
filled the skies hammering Ukrainian
positions then in March came a
breakthrough for Russia mosco launched a
surprise attack the full impact of which
is still unclear but soon after the
attack Ukrainian troops began to
retreat on Saturday US president Trump
said thousands of Ukrainian soldiers
were encircled in
ksk Russia even had a message for them
from President Putin he said if they
surrender he would spend their
lives I would like to emphasize that if
they lay down their arms and surrender
they will be guaranteed life and decent
treatment in accordance with the Norms
of international law and the laws of the
Russian
Federation Ukraine has dismissed these
claims it insists that no troops are
encircled that Ukrainian forces still
hold ground in ksk and that they've
redeployed to quote unquote favorable
positions
but how much do they really control 70%
of their previously held territory is
gone so Ukraine is clearly on the
defensive and president zilinski knows
that he's named a new chief of general
staff in an effort to improve combat
Effectiveness we decided that Andre HOV
will be the new chief of the general
staff he is a battle hardened man and
his key tasks will be maximizing combat
experience of our brigades in
operational planning both defensive and
offensive as well as accelerating the
development of the core
system guess the Cur Advantage is all
but lost meanwhile Russia is ramping up
its attacks on Sunday Moscow launched 90
Iranian Shahid drones 9090 drones they
targeted nine Ukrainian regions on
Monday Russia attacked the Ukrainian
Capital blasts were heard across
Kiev all of this could stop with a peace
deal the question is is such a deal even
coming peace like war will come at a
price and for Ukraine that price may be
higher than it ever
imagined the Trump Putin call tomorrow
could be the turning point will this be
a moment for diplomacy or just another
pause before the ne next
escalation in the next 24 hours we may
have our answer

in Pakistan the hunter has become the
hunted for decades Islamabad sponsored
terrorism in the region but now they're
at the receiving end the only downside
innocent pakistanis are paying the price
for it and the generals still lounging
in Comfort last week an entire train was
hijacked in baluchistan the attack was
planned by the bla the boo Liberation
Army which is a separatist group in the
region on Sunday they struck again the
bla targeted a military Convoy in the
district of nooski they drove a truck
full of bombs into the Convoy take a
look at this
the bla claims 90 Pakistani soldiers
were killed but the official death toll
is five plus 30 soldiers injured this
was again a daring attack by the Balo
Liberation Army and their target
remained the same Pakistan's military
both these attacks show a level of
complexity the BL chose risky targets
they made videos of the attacks and they
made sure to Target the military
even the hijack train was carrying
dozens of military personnel so how is
the Army responding well right now they
seem to be in a State of Shock clearly
the generals did not anticipate this
tomorrow they're expected to brief
Pakistani lawmakers after that the
parliament will hold a closed door
session all signals point to a Crackdown
but even that may not help because
Pakistan's problem is more
complicated they're not dealing with one
group they are dealing with multiple
groups groups like The BL in baluchistan
and the Pakistani Taliban or the TTP in
kber pakun different groups different
tactics different ideologies but the
same enemy Pakistan's military these
groups have become emboldened since 2021
that's when the Afghan Taliban took
power in Kabul they have been giving
shelter and weapons to these groups
sound familiar doesn't
it a rogue regime supporting terrorists
against a neighbor
it's what Pakistan does to India but
right now Afghanistan is doing it to
them in fact I'll show you some numbers
in
2021 403 Terror attacks were reported in
Pakistan 403 in 2022 that number Rose to
52 in 2023 it was
789 and last year
1,16 these numbers make one thing quite
clear Pakistan is facing a major sec
security crisis this is the highest
level of violence in almost 10 years and
Islamabad is blaming its neighbors for
it both India and
afan we
understand main
sponsor your Eastern neighbor this is
yet another incident of terrorism
or it is a part of a process that is
going on beyond the blame game what's
the Playbook Pakistan adopted a strategy
in 2014 it is called the nap the
National Action Plan think of it as
Pakistan's anti-terror Playbook it
combines crackdowns with non-military
measures like reforms and development
programs but this Playbook
has had three problems problem number
one is the lack of global support
Pakistan has been complaining about
terrorism at the United Nations but no
one is paying attention to them and why
should they why would they Islamabad
played a double game on terrorism they
betrayed the Americans once so why
should they trust Pakistan again the
second problem is the selective approach
Pakistan May oppose the TTP or Balo
insurgents but they still sponsor
terrorism against India they still have
good and bad terrorists as long as that
does not change Pakistan will not make
progress and finally problem number
three the economy is still in the dumps
I mentioned non-military measures in the
anti-terrorism plan measures like giving
jobs to young people building critical
public infrastructure and ensuring
overall Prosperity Pakistan has not been
able to do that but frankly none of this
should surprise anyone Pakistan created
a radicalization factory what what else
would it produce except
terrorists we live in a world of
Shifting alliances and Rising security
threats no wonder then that intelligence
diplomacy is taking Center Stage this
weekend India played host to a
high-profile security conclave bringing
together some of the most powerful
intelligence Chiefs from across the
globe it was convened by India's
national security adviser Ajit doal on

visit it's the first highlevel
engagement between India and the
intelligence arm of the new Trump
Administration the former congresswoman
and presidential candidate took charge
as the dni earlier this year and this
trip signals a strengthening of Indo US
security ties in her one-on-one meeting
with Dalal the discussions focused on
bolstering intelligent sharing
mechanisms and deepening cooperation she
also met with defense minister rajat
Singh the meetings that I've had here uh
with different Indian government uh
officials and intelligence officials
really is set on that Foundation of how
we can continue to integrate how we can
continue to strengthen our relationship
not only of course in my area of int
Ence uh but we're looking at Commerce
and trade and defense and and uh
education there's there's nothing but
opportunity that I see here uh in the US
India partnership India has hosted this
conclave since 2022 that's when the
intelligence Chiefs started meeting
quietly on the sidelines of the risina
dialogue this conclave served as a
crucial forum for intelligence and
security officials from Nations
including five eyes members like
Australia New Zealand the UK and Canada
there are no details about the agenda
but reports suggest that the focus was
on counterterrorism Rising security
threats and the indopacific
region uh obviously as it relates to
China there are challenges uh there are
also opportunities uh and we have two
leaders of two very important countries
who will play a very Central role in
taking on those challenges uh resolving
issues where they exist and also also
maximizing uh any
opportunities also present at the
meeting was Daniel Rogers the head of
the Canadian Security intelligence
service India Canada ties have been
strained since the killing of hardip
Singh ner in
2023 former Canadian Prime Minister
Justin Trudeau accused Indian agents of
involvement there was diplomatic Fallout
and a Severe deterioration in relations
while no official statements were made
this conclave provided an opport Unity
to ease tensions and find common ground
on counterterrorism
cooperation while this conclave is
significant it is not unprecedented over
the years India has hosted several
highlevel security meetings recognizing
the importance of intelligence diplomacy
past Gatherings have paved the way for
joint counterterrorism operations
intelligence sharing packs and deeper
strategic
Partnerships this latest meeting
reinforces India's growing role as a key
player in Global Security
discourse as conflicts become more
complex and transnational threats more
sophisticated intelligence diplomacy
will play a bigger role especially in
shaping International security policies
while the outcomes of this conclave
remain unknown the message is clear
intelligence Partnerships are no longer
optional they are imperative
now let's turn our attention to North
Macedonia this is a small landlocked
nation in Southeastern Europe it is home
to just 1.8 million people and they have
witnessed the worst tragedy in recent
memory a fire at a nightclub has killed
at least 59 people this is the biggest
loss of life in the country since the
early
1990s more than 150 people have been
injured suffering from extensive Burns
and carbon monoxide
poisoning so how did this tragedy unfold
and who is at fault our next report
tells
you, 1500 clubgoers crammed into a
nightclub in the Eastern town of kachani
in North Macedonia enjoying a concert by
the popular hip-hop Duo
DNK then around 2:30 a.m. pyrotechnic
devices on the stage went
off Sparks hit the ceiling made of
Highly flamable material within moments
the flame spread violently scenes of
chaos erupted inside the club musicians
urged people to escape quickly most of
whom were teenagers and young adults
people were running through the smoke
rushing towards the exit getting caught
in the crush and being trampled
on the fire broke out everyone started
screaming and shouting get out get out
but unfortunately the there was only one
exit and there were 1,500 people inside
then everyone started pushing each other
so I headed for the exit I don't know
how but I ended up on the ground I
couldn't get up and at that moment
people started stomping on
me as the blaze ripped through the
Nightclub at least 59 people died
including one of the two lead singers
more than 155 people were injured dozens
of whom suffered from extensive Burns
and carbon oxide
poisoning I am the father of one of the
children affected by the great tragedy
she has Burns also has smoke inhalation
I just know that there are many children
who have suffered the doctors are doing
their job but the number is
Big this is the worst tragedy in recent
memory to befall North Macedonia which
is home to about 1.8 million
people this small Southeast European
country has declared a 7-Day period of
mourning the government has offered its
condolences we express our condolences
to the families of the victims and we
need to remain calm in Our intention to
take all steps to ensure that such a
thing never happens again many European
leaders have condoled the tragedy
including European commission president
Ursula Von Delan and neighboring Serbian
President Alexander vuich
an investigation is underway according
to the preliminary findings the
nightclub was operating illegally with a
crowd far exceeding the venue's
capacity the nightclub had a falsified
license issued in March 2024 for a bribe
therefore everything that's happening
and will happen must have criminal
responsibility for every last one
involved regardless of who they are from
which institution from what level from
which party and profession and so on up
to the very last
one police have detained 15 people for
questioning under the suspicion of
bribery and Corruption after all the
club was previously a carpet warehouse
it didn't have a license to operate the
building had only one exit which fueled
the Stampede and the fire extinguishing
system had
faults the government has been quick to
respond with a probe the seriously
injured are receiving treatment in
specialist clinics across Europe in
Bulgaria Greece Serbia and turkey but
the anger among the people is
palpable the tragedy that occurred in
the small dark and illegal former
Warehouse has shocked and angered the
Balkan Nation
and it will take the government a lot
more than a few words of condolences to
escape the consequences of this deadly
Inferno let's turn to India now where
prime minister Narendra Modi is riding
the podcast wave the first one came out
in January the second one yesterday
Prime Minister Modi sat down with
American podcaster Lex fredman he
discussed Life religion politics and
history we are bringing you the top six
highlights number one Modi says Trump is
more prepared this time he says Trump
stands for America First and he stands
for India first which is why both
leaders get along so well I have
observed president Trump both during his
first term and now in his second
run this time he seems far more prepared
than before he has a clear road map in
his mind with well defined steps each
one designed to lead him toward his
goals Modi also praised Trump for his
courage especially after the
assassination attempts last year next is
highlight number two Prime Minister Modi
wants a reset with China he pointed to
both historical and contemporary
equations if we look back centuries
there's no real history of conflict
between us of
course differences are natural but our
Focus is to ensure that these
differences don't turn into disputes
since the 21st century is Asia Century
we want India and China to compete in a
healthy and natural way that's a clear
commitment from Modi he wants a healthy
relationship with China it also shows
how the tone has softened just last year
India was slamming China for violating
agreements and renaming sides but now
the approach is more positive even
China's foreign Ministry has noticed
this they have welcomed prime minister
Mod's remarks next is highlight number
three Prime Minister Modi is hopeful of
a peace deal in Ukraine he says he told
Putin that this is not the time for war
and he told zalinsky the resolution will
only come at the talking table Modi is
basically telling Ukraine to wake up and
smell the coffee regardless of how many
people stand with you in the
world there will never be a resolution
on the battlefield Ukraine May hold
countless discussions with their allies
but it will bear no fruit a pretty clear
message to zilinsky here don't think
your allies will help you out sit down
with President Putin and talk things out
the Prime Minister also referred to
Trump's change in position he says it
creates an opportunity for Meaningful
and productive talks highlight number
four criticism of global
institutions organizations like the
United Nations came into being after the
first World War
but they failed to evolve with the times
and this
inability to adapt has sparked a global
debate on their
relevance the timing of this criticism
is key political bodies like the United
Nations have failed to stop conflicts
trade bodies like the World Trade
Organization have failed to stop tariff
Wars so their relevance is indeed under
question it is also why India is pushing
for reforms and next is highlight number
five Pakistan and terrorism Prime
Minister Modi recalled his Outreach in
2014 when he first took office he
invited then prime minister nawas Sharif
to his swearing in ceremony in 2014 but
the warmth was not reciprocated Modi
says terrorism is deeply rooted in
Pakistan but he also said the people of
Pakistan yearn for peace that they weary
of the Bloodshed highlight number six is
artificial intelligence we have been
debating the question of whether AI can
replace us the Indian Prime Minister
says it cannot
I firmly believe that no technology can
ever replace the boundless creativity
and Imagination of the human mind now
look humans have an innate ability to
care for each
other the natural tendency to be
concerned about one
another now can someone tell me is AI
capable of this a strong vote for human
creativity which brings us to the final
highlight Elon Musk and Doge every
country is now debating the the idea of
cost cutting Indian Prime Minister Modi
is also in favor of it he says the Doge
Mission makes him happy he also Drew
parallels to India things like ghost
names in a pension scheme or benefits
being given to people who were not
eligible for them like a widow pension
before marriage so put together this
conversation was around 3 hours and 17
minutes it was basically a window to
prime minister modi's world view about
diplomacy about conflict resolution
about global institutions and about the
changing world order the PM rarely goes
into such detail about these issues but
this time he did and in the process he
gave a glimpse into Modi the Statesman
he's completed almost 11 years in office
he's one of the most experienced world
leaders going around and clearly he's
Keen to take up that extra
responsibility we've seen Modi the
politician and Modi the Prime Minister
this time we saw Modi the
Statesman it's round two of the US
versus South Africa battle Washington
has launched another attack it has
expelled South Africa's ambassador to
the United States the ambassador's name
is Ibrahim rasul his AER was announced
by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio
Rubio called rasul a race baiting
politician who hates America and hates
porter porter of course stands for
president of the United States so Rubio
says the Ambassador hates president
Donald Trump this was apparently why he
was declared Persona non- grata and
given a few days to leave the US
and like I said this is just the latest
spat between the US and South Africa our
next report tells you why the two
countries are at
loggerheads US Secretary of State Marco
Rubio put up this social media post on
Friday he said that South Africa's
ambassador to the US was no longer
welcome there Rubio called Ambassador
Ibrahim rasul a race bating politician
who hates America and hates Donald Trump
Rubio also put up a link to a news
article it has a provocative image where
it looks like the Ambassador is saying
that Trump is leading the global white
supremacist movement he didn't actually
say those words that's just the title of
the article when you click the link the
image has different subtitles but the
article implies the same thing it says
the South African Ambassador was
addressing a seminar and he told his
audience that Donald Trump is leading a
white supremacist
movement the article quotes a part of
Ambassador raso's speech starting from
the Middle the Ambassador said some
things before the part that was quoted
which could provide more context the
speech is free for everyone to see
online but Rubio probably doesn't care
about that the particular article's
interpretation gave him a reason to
expel the South African
Diplomat reports said that rasul wasn't
a popular figure in Washington because
of his criticism of Israel his Pro pal
stance and his alleged past criticism of
Donald Trump so it seems rasul had a
Target on his back and his recent speech
was just the excuse Rubio needed to
expel
him South Africa noted the expulsion
Pretoria called it regrettable but said
that it remains committed to building a
mutually beneficial relationship with
the United States of America so it
sounds like South Africa will not
retaliate raso's expulsion is just the
latest to Salvo in the growing spat
between the US and South
Africa last month Trump signed this
executive order halting all us Aid to
South Africa Washington accused Petoria
of treating its Africana minority with
shocking disregard and trying to seize
their property without
compensation this has not happened South
Africa just updated a law from the 1970s
the updated bill could allow South
Africa's government to seize land under
exceptional circumstances but the Trump
Administration believes that the new law
is unjust and immoral so they cut Aid to
South
Africa that isn't all Rubio also
boycotted a G20 meet in South Africa
last month he repeated the false charge
that Petoria was expropriating private
property and he said South Africa was
using G20 to promote Dei diversity
equity and inclus inclusion Trump and
his team are dead against Dei so Rubio
said he would not attend the G20
meeting it seems like Washington is
spoiling for a fight with Petoria but
the South African government keeps
trying to diffuse tensions one
explanation for this could be a critical
trade
deal the African growth and opportunity
act this deal lets subsaharan countries
including South Africa sell some Goods
to the US Duty free the deal is a boon
for South African exports so they don't
want to get kicked off the program but
that doesn't mean that ptor is happy
about all of this so it may be looking
for other trading
partners this Summit is taking place at
a time of global
uncertainty Global uncertainty which we
spoke a little bit about in our T
atet which is characterized by Rising
unilateralism economic
nationalism and a retreat
from what we've always wanted to advance
which is adherence to international law
a world order that seeks to advance All
Nations which is also departing from
what we would call Human Rights
culture South Africa's president sir r
proposa met with a European Union
delegation last week the EU is also
upset with the us over the Tariff
threats from the Trump Administration so
the EU is looking for new trade partners
and Petoria said it would Forge closer
ties with Europe their ambassador to the
US was expelled just days later is that
just a coincidence or was the US lashing
out we'll see in the weeks to come
imagine this you go on a foreign
business trip for about a week then
things go horribly wrong there is one
technical hiccup after another there is
a political blame game over your visit
there are few feasible solutions to
bring you back and you end up stranded
for n whole months sounds bad right now
imagine if this unexpected layover
happened in anti-gravity not in another
country but in outer space because
that's exactly what happened to two NASA
astronauts Sun Williams and Barry
Wilmore they have been stranded in space
but after a long wait of nine whole
months they're all set to return
tomorrow here's a report so it adds a
little different perspective and you
know NASA astronaut Sunita Williams and
Barry Wilmore have remained in space for
months longer than
expected but they could be back
tomorrow let's get going now let's put
some fire in this rocket
The Saga began in June
2024 the pair arrived at the
International Space Station to test a
spacecraft called
Starliner it was built by the Aerospace
firm Boeing Williams and Wilmore were
due to be on the ISS for only 8 days but
there were technical issues in the
experimental
spacecraft the astronauts could not come
back on it
so NASA decided to bring them on
Boeing's rival spacex's Dragon
capsule both president Donald Trump and
SpaceX CEO Elon Musk have blamed Joe
Biden's politics for the
hiccups due to delays in sending the new
capsule to the space station Williams
and Wilmore have been stranded in space
for more than 9 months now and this
unexpected anti-gravity layover has
garnered Global attempt and sympathy all
right going through the but things are
about to change last week NASA said that
a replacement crew of astronauts will be
launched to the
ISS typically two groups of astronauts
the new arrivals and the ones going home
overlap on the
station when the new group of astronauts
arrive Williams and Wilmore would be
able to
leave on Sunday NASA completed the first
bit
a SpaceX capsule carrying the
replacement crew docked at the
ISS at the hatch opened and astronauts
embraced their counterparts it was all
smiles and hugs the first of the
Flies space
xen welcome aboard the SS and Houston
thank you for uh tuning in this early
morning was a a wonderful day great to
see our friends arrive so thank you so
much
there will be a two-day Handover meaning
on Tuesday the old crew will begin their
Journey back to Earth thanks to our
there could be a small delay depending
on the weather conditions but the
astronauts can only hope that their
return is successful is back on Earth
that Landing coming at while both
Wilmore and Williams have repeatedly
said that they are happy to be on board
this overstretched trip is likely to
have come with a personal cost
we're not just talking about the
separation from one's home and
family spending long periods of time
without gravity can wreak havoc on the
human
body it can cause bone density loss
reduce blood volume change the way blood
flows leading to clots weaker eyesight
and problems that come with exposure to
radiation in
space radiation has a number of effects
on cells but basically you're worried
about it um depending on the kind of
dose breaking down um the way the cells
work and potentially introducing um
breaks and changes into the proteins and
the DNA that's within the
cell so when the astronauts do come back
they will undergo a long period of
recovery at least 45 days of intensive
reconditioning we we have a um a for um
we call it a a reconditioning uh plan uh
and and I I described a little bit about
how when crew go into space their body
adapts to being in space well they kind
of have to do the same thing but in
Reverse they have to readapt to being
back on the
ground in a lot of ways Sunita Williams
and Barry Wilmore will have to retrain
themselves to get back into their bodies
their so-called baseline from before
they left
but before that happens they will need
to get back to Earth and the world hopes
that tomorrow is when that happens Sash
and I want you to take a moment and
think about all the stories that we
covered in today's show spanning
different geographies featuring
different world leaders and focusing on
different issues what is the one theme
that sums them up our world is changing
rapidly there are constant disruptions
shifting alliances and Rising risk of
conflict at a time like this dialogue is
the only way forward and that's the
message that India has for the world in
fact India is giving a platform to
thought leaders and policy makers to
engage in conversation through its
Premier Global Summit the Rina dialogue
it starts today we at first post are
partnering with the Observer Research
Foundation or ORF to bring you the ideas
pod but will feature more than 30
interviews and discussions with world
leaders earlier today we spoke with Sam
s the president of ORF and curator of
the risina dialogue to understand the
theme and the highlights and to tell you
what you can expect here's a snippet of
that
[Music]
conversation here at the idea spot we
are hosting more than 30 sessions we are
excited about all of them but which one
conversation excites you personally the
most or are you looking forward to p and
the Ukraine minister is a good
conversation uh the conversation with
the iaea chief you know nuclear
proliferation is now just waiting to
rare its ugly head all over I think
that's a second good conversation I like
the few conversation on Taiwan and China
which are really important but I also
like uh the conversation on on the
transatlantic relationship most
difficult relationship today is us and
Europe that is the most difficult
bilateral relationship it is going
through complete churn they are they
friends they disagree dramatically they
don't have channels to make peace when
you disagree right they were always in
agreement but when you started this some
10 years back uh what what is it that
made you uh think that we need a
platform to bring in leaders from all
over the world and and I see year after
year people with different ideological
leanings people with different
geographical uh backgrounds different
projects uh that they've taken up as as
thought leaders as policy makers what
made you think that that we should be
hosting something like this for a
country that contributes one six of
humanity at that time um we were still
looking at platforms outside the country
pretty much like you P you want to build
you have built an international news
platform out of India when one six of
humanity uh can which six of humanity
can identify with relate to in many ways
also also be informed through the same
thing was also true of the of the
Strategic dialogues and the think tank
conclaves which were basically AL
Western designed where the agenda was
written by them they held the pen they
decided who spoke they they decided when
to give the bik to someone and they
decided the theme that they would
agitate now we were literally performers
in a circus when we went to Western
platforms we will not be talking about
India's role in the world India's role
in technology India's progress in XY Z
we will be talking about the deepest
darkest elements of of of any region
that by the way abounds everywhere but
we were performers in their gladiatorial
you know Arenas and and and it had to
change you could say it's a
manifestation of what Dr J Shanker says
that we we dropping the hesitations of
History we absolutely we've found our
place and we've claimed it we were
scared that we will we don't we don't
want to be caught saying something which
is slightly different uh on our own
platforms but we were happy to say the
same thing sitting outside why yeah we
should have the debates here in fact uh
we should also create some of our own
circuses here we should have people come
and fight out their Reg
I see how you you you curated some of
the panels so you know it's time for us
to see some to have the inside view of
of certain other conversations I have
seen the big charts that you furiously
write on uh but do you want to tell our
audience what does it take to pull off a
summit of this magnitude with so many
players so many U egos to to manage so
many uh so much logistical challenge it
takes 20 committed team members mhm who
are willing to forego their personal
lives for a longest have you heard of
work life
balance I'm telling you I have heard of
it and I'm still trying to discover it
today the team uh is fantastic we have
2,000 folks 131 countries um we have
seven hotels we have thousands of of fly
flights to curate but they do it with a
smile and they do it very well
and now it's time for ventage shots
images that tell the story The Vatican
releases the first photograph of the
Pope in more than a month France calls
off a football match after fans threw
smoke bombs on the pitch and a pet
friendly tram offers a unique experience
in China also taking you back in history
on this day in
1992 white South Africans voted
decisively to end apartate which is a
system or was a system of
institutionalized racial segregation
68.7% supported reforms to dismantle
minority rule which marked a historic
Turning Point Paving the way for a
democratic South Africa we leaving you
on that note thank you for watching
we'll see you tomorrow
