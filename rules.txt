Use the following instructions to generate a clean, well-organized, and complete report based on a news transcript. The goal is to extract **every topic covered** and break them down using a clear hierarchical structure with headings, subheadings, and bullet points.

---

**General Formatting Rules**

**Index at the Top**  
Begin with a section titled: `## Index of Topics Covered in the Notes`.  
List all main topics mentioned in the transcript.  
Number each topic clearly (e.g., 1, 2, 3, ...).  
Each item should match the main headline sections below.

**Main Topics as Headings**  
Each main topic must be formatted as a level-two heading: `##`.  
Headings must be short, clear, and informative (e.g., `## Putin-Trump Ukraine Ceasefire Talks`).

**Subheadings for Subtopics**  
Use level-three headings (`###`) only once under each main topic to give a short contextual intro labeled as `### Intro to Topic`.  
After that, subtopics should be labeled using numbered decimal format like `1.1`, `1.2`, `2.1`, etc.

**Subtopic Format**  
Each subtopic uses the following format:
```
1.1 Subheadline  
• Bullet point explaining key info  
• Bullet point explaining supporting detail  
```
Use **dotted bullets (•)** for all points.  
Keep bullets clear, short, and informative.

**Language and Style**  
• Use **neutral, objective, and concise** language.  
• Avoid complex sentences and jargon.  
• Ensure every bullet clearly communicates a single fact or idea.

**Completeness**  
• Cover **all topics and subtopics mentioned** in the transcript.  
• Do not omit any events, names, or issues—even minor ones.  
• Maintain chronological or logical flow where applicable.
