## ✅ **Prompt Rules for Structured News Transcript Report**

Use the following set of instructions whenever I ask for a "**report**" of a news transcript. Follow these rules exactly:

---

## ✅ **General Formatting Rules**

1. **Headlines as Headings**
   - Use clear, short, and informative headings (Heading Level 2: "##") for each main topic.
   - Under each main heading, create an "**Intro to Topic**" subheading (Heading Level 3: "###") to briefly summarize context and background.

2. **Numbered Bullet Points**
   - Use numbered bullet points in a structured hierarchical format:
     - Main points numbered as 1, 2, 3, etc.
     - Sub-points numbered as 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2, etc.
   - Each point should be concise and easy to understand.
   - If a point becomes too long or complicated, break it into clear sub-points.

3. **Language and Style**
   - Use simple sentences to explain details clearly.
   - Maintain an objective and neutral tone throughout the notes.
   - Ensure clarity by avoiding jargon or complex language.

4. **Completeness**
   - Cover **every topic** mentioned in the original news transcript.
   - Do not skip or omit any topic or sub-topic from the transcript.

## ✅ **Structure of the Report**

### A. **Index at the Beginning**
- At the start of your notes, provide an index listing all headlines/topics covered in your report.
- Number each headline clearly (e.g., 1, 2, 3...).

**Example:**
```
## Index of Topics Covered in the Notes
1. Putin's Stance on Ukraine Ceasefire  
2. Donald Trump's Economic Policies and Market Collapse  
3. Canada's New Prime Minister: Mark Carney  
...
```

### B. **Headline Sections**
For each headline/topic listed in your index, follow this exact structure:

```
## [Headline Name]

### Intro to Topic
- Provide a brief context or background explaining:
  - What is happening?
  - Why is it important?
  - What led to this situation?

1. Main Point One
   1.1 Sub-point (if needed)
   1.2 Sub-point (if needed)

2. Main Point Two
   2.1 Sub-point (if needed)
   ...

(Continue numbering as required)
```
